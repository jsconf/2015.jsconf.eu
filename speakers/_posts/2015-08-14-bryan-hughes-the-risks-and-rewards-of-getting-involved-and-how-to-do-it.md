  Does it seem like everyone else knows more than you? Do you see people on stage
  or organizing events and think, "I could never do what they do"? Have you felt
  marginalized by the tech industry? Getting involved can be a daunting prospect,
  especially if you're from a marginalized group. But there are a few decent and
  kind communities out there, and getting involved can be highly rewarding. It's
  also a lot easier than you think!



  In this talk, I will discuss how I got involved as a not straight male, how you
  can do it too, and how we can make our communities better and more welcoming
  for everyone.
