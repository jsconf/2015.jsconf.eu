  Moving up the ladder from forklift driver and general labourer, to front end
  developer, with a stint in manual testing, was a big challenge. However it's
  exactly what I did, and I couldn't have done it without following a few core
  principles.



  Getting up the nerve to go to local usergroups, and conferences, and
  discovering a new found love of public speaking, was a huge leap from
  labouring. Similarly, I discovered contributing to open source wasn't that big
  a deal, and some things certain projects did made it really easy! Also,
  learning about things like source control was super integral to being where
  I am today.
