Hi, this is Tiffany, Jan, Karolina, Holger & Malte, the JSConf EU curators.

Itâ€™s usually around this time of the year that we reveal our plans for the next JSConf EU, so here it goes:  

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce **JSConf EU 2017**! Thatâ€™s right, [together with CSSconf EU](), JSConf EU is pressing the pause button in 2016 and will return only a few months later than usual, in **spring 2017**.  

Itâ€™s been a fantastic SEVEN years running JSConf EU, learning a lot with each event and using it to improve the next. JSConf EU 2015 [was magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ1kY-CSpBk&list=PL37ZVnwpeshH37NxpV6XbgdDpY-w48hMd), it topped expectations and we are all really happy and proud to have taken part in its making.

Yet, the organisation and running of a conference is a taxing endeavour. Like [CSSconf EU](http://2015.cssconf.eu/), JSConf EU is organised by volunteers who dedicate much of their spare time to deliver the best event possible and after seven years we feel a little worn out. So, we've agreed that now would be a good time to take a break, recharge, and come back better than ever! 

But donâ€™t despair! There are A LOT of JSConfs going on in 2016, you just have to take your pick:

- [JSConf Iceland](http://jsconf.is)
- [JSConf Budapest](http://jsconfbp.com)
- [JSConf Uruguay](https://jsconf.uy)
- [JSConf Belgium](http://jsconf.be/)
- [JSConf Asia](http://jsconf.asia)

See you all at *some* JSConf ðŸ‘‹
